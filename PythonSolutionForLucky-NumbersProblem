# basically, we need to find the no. of 4's and 7's in the given number and then tell whether the count is lucky number or no:);
#here since n is <=10^18, there will be at max 19 digits. so no of lucky numbers till 19 is only 2 i.e 4 and 7! so easy. just count no of digits which are either 4 or 7
# and if the count is either 4 or 7 then print "YES" else "NO";
# code:
n = input()    #take input
count = 0           # start count with 0    
for c in n:                    # iterate over the number n and increase the count by 1 if the digit is either 4 or 7;
    if c == '4' or c == '7':
        count += 1
if(count==4 or count==7):         
    print("YES") 
    
else:
    print ("NO")
